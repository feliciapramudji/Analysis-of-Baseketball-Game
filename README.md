# Ideal Body Size and Skills Required for each Position in Basketball
### The very first project that I worked on was a project on basketball, where my partner and I was trying to predict how good a player will be based on their body size and skills. The goal was to prove the hypothesis that certain positions require certain body sizes -- height and weight of the player. We built different models -- logistic regression, decision tree, random forest-- to determine the highest accuracy to predict on player's position based on the features that they have. We touched upon the height and weight and built on data visualizations that focused on the features that impact on the winning rate on various basketball teams.
